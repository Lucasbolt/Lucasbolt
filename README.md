# "Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall." – Confucius

## Hi, I'm Chisom 👋

![Banner Image](https://github.com/Lucasbolt/images/blob/main/reduced_cyber.jpeg?raw=true)

I'm a Backend Engineer with years of hands-on experience building backend systems, developer tooling, bots, and platform APIs. I have a background in Electrical Engineering, trained through ALX's backend engineering program, and I've taught myself most of what I know through projects, reading, and real-world trial.

---

### 🔧 What I Do

- 🛠 Building modular, API-first backend systems — REST, WebSockets, GraphQL, gRPC
- ⚙️ Automating workflows with bots and scripts for Telegram, Discord, and internal tools
- 📦 Working with queues, workers, webhooks, and rate-limiting pipelines
- ☁️ Shipping production apps using Docker, GitHub Actions, and Google Cloud Run
- 🔐 Designing secure systems (OAuth2, RBAC, secrets management, request validation)
- 🔄 Currently building: a social platform for discovering and sharing events

---

### 🧰 My Toolbox

- **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, C
- **Frameworks:** Node.js (Express, NestJS), Flask
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, MySQL
- **Messaging:** Redis Pub/Sub, RabbitMQ, BullMQ
- **DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions, GCP (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Secret Manager)
- **Testing:** Postman, Jest, Mocha

### 🧠 Interests

System architecture, automation, infrastructure, event-driven design, and real-world problem solving. I enjoy long-form content, security research, and reading about metaphysics and consciousness. I'm also a believer that small, useful systems > over-engineered complexity.
